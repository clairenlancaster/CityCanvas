## üèóÔ∏è Project Summary:

City Canvas is an iOS mobile app that's community-driven; it enables street art lovers to learn about and share local street art. 

Users can view street art in both a map and list view. They can also read information on, comment on, like and access directions from their current location to a selected piece of street art.

Furthermore, users can share new street art, uploading pictures from their devices photo library.

This is all done from a logged in state where users sign up with unique usernames and emails.
